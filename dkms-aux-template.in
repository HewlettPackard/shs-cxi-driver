# The CXI driver has optional support for AMD, Intel, and Nvidia GPUs
# including support for nvidia and nvidia-open driver variants.
#
# For GPUs, controls for optional support:
#
#       DISABLE_GPU_* _must_ be an integer
#
#               0               -> enabled
#               non-zero        -> disabled
#
#       PATH_GPU_* _must_ an absolute path the DKMS source to use for that
#       GPU driver.  For portability in paths, use DKMS's ${source_tree}.
#
# If PATH_GPU_<GPU-NAME> is not defined but its inclusion is _not_ _disabled_
# by DISABLE_GPU_<GPU-NAME>=<non-zero>,  then an attempt to find and use the
# latest version of <GPU-NAME> from ${source_tree} will be made.
