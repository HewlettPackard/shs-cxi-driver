Description:    Show the current bitmask for error flags. A value of 0
                means an interrupt will be generated for the error,
                while 1 means no interrupt will happen, although the
                corresponding error flag may be set. This field is
                read-only. The format of the bitmask is a set of comma
                separated 32-bit words in hex format, such as
                "e0000003,00000000"

Description:    The Cassini driver will mask an error interrupt bit if its
                rate becomes too high. But for some error bits, this must
                not happen. For instance the PI UC_ATTENTION bits must never
                be disabled because they are used to communicate with the
                micro-controller. Most default to 0. The format of the bitmask
                is a set of comma separated 32-bit words in hex format,
                such as "f0018003,00000000". Only change with caution.
